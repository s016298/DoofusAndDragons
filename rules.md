Lore:
    Once in the future the 2 gods Boofus and Doofus had a good time listening to vaporwave. But then some dork called Rabbajaggalaggatagga teleported into the present so his past was his future but because of the time travel he only remembered the future, so did he remember the past or the future? This made Doofus really confused so he summoned Satan from the timerift of the 10 trillionth dimension, but then Doofus became evil in the past and the future and the present. The timerift also merged all time together into one, but it sometimes does stupid stuff.

A rap battle begins. The DM decides who is the winner. The winner gets + 30 health and +5 STR or INT (depending on whether the character is a physical fighter or a magic user).

Weapons and Armor
Grades (Armor and weapons)
Weebish
Weak
Brittle
Old Fashioned
Okay
Cool
Rad
Sk8ter
Ancient Sk8ter
Memelord’s
Dorkeck
Different kinds of weapons:
Sword = Added DMG 1, but can swing as many times as SPD/3
Battleaxe = Added DMG 6 + STR/5, SPD is lowered by 1 for three turns
Handaxe = Added DMG 4 + STR/10
Mage’s Staff = Added DMG 3 + INT/5 2-3 Range
Wand = Added DMG 1, but can cast as many times as SPD/3 1-2 range
Bow = Added DMG 4 +STR/5 2-3 range
Short Bow Added DMG 2 But can attack as many times as SPD/4 1-2 range
Throwing spear Added DMG 1 each 2 range
Dog
Statue
Exploding barrel
Frying Pan *Class Specific - Added DMG 2
 Cannon *Class Specific - Added DMG 8
Crossbow - Added DMG 4
Hamster Wheel-4 legged only - Can shoot lightning after five consecutive melee attacks

Weapons add damage to an attack. For example, an attack that deals five damage would deal 9 damage with a weebish sword and base stats. Let’s break this down.
First of all, we must calculate how much damage the weapon adds. If we take a look at the Sword’s DMG, it is 1 DMG  * Swing Speed, which is SPD/3 rounded down. With base stats, Swing Speed would be three damage, because SPD is 10, divided by three is 3.33, rounded down to 3. Now we must add the rank of the weapon, which is shown above. Since our hypothetical sword is weebish we would add 1 to the weapon’s damage. Finally, we add this to the damage of the attack, five, and get nine.
So to review:
1WeaponGrade + (1WeaponDamage*Speed/3)NumberOfAttacks + 5AttackDamage = Damage in attack.

Kinds of armor: 


Heavy - Is the strongest but doesn’t have any special effects unless enchanted
Mage - Provides magical bonuses, but only if the class is magic based
Light - Provides speed bonuses
Emperor’s Gown - Causes Créme-dreme in enemies
Plumber’s Boots

Armor strength is TOU * 2 for light and heavy, INT + INT/5 for mage, and RAN  for Emperor’s Gown and Plumber’s boots, added with the ranking of the level of armor (or TOU-10 for unique armors). For example weebish heavy armor on a character with all base stats would give a protection value of 21, while Obsidian Armor (a unique armor set) would give a value of 20.

Armor value is then multiplied by .02 and rounded down to the tenth. Any attack will have its power multiplied by this value, and then this value is discounted from the normal amount of damage it would do.
So, regarding the previous example of weebish heavy armor with all defaults, lets try it. The attack power will be 10.
(10 - (21*.02*(10))) = ~6

  
Currency: Sunflower seeds

2 sunflower seeds ~~ 1 cent


If you want dollars to sunflower seeds, multiply the dollar value by 200. (E.g. 4 dollars - 800 sunflower seeds)

HERE’S THE HARD PART! (STATS!)

Strength (STR)
Toughness (TOU)
Speed (SPD)
Intelligence (INT)
Randomness (RAN)

All of these stats start at 10.

Base HP = TOU * 5 + dRAN (what that means is that you go on to random.org, go from 1 to your RAN stat, and click go.)

Attacks are based on d20 rolls + STR - 10 or INT - 10(depending on physical or magical), if the roll is over the number that the DM decides, it succeeds, crits (20 on a d20) do double damage in combat and make exceptional successes in non-combat (basic D&D stuff) Every time a roll is successful, a “stat marker” is added to the player. 4 stat markers = stat +1 (this replaces levelling up and exp).
